        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            Privacy is crucial to protecting the rights of the people, and to getting true and honest reports when
            someone's rights are violated. Legalitarian products will never collect information that could be used to
            identify a user, except when the user decides to submit it in a report. We will not share a user's
            indetifiable information without their consent. All information submitted by a user is encrypted in transit
            and at rest, and indentifying and contact information like a user's name or email address are stored
            separately from their reports.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users will never be required to identify themselves or sign up for an account to access information or
            submit a report in a Legalitarian product.
        </p>
        <p>
            Legalitarian will never collect information entered into forms on its websites except when the user submits
            that information using a button in the form.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users may choose to make their identifying and contact information available to a specific Legalitarian
            partner. That information is still stored securely and separately from the other information they submitted.
            However, when user-submitted information is provided to Legalitarian partners, the identifying information
            for a user who chose to share it is provided alongside the other information they submitted.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Tracking Use of Legalitarian Products
        </h2>
        <p>
            Legalitarian may collect information about the use of its products. This will never include personal
            identifiable information nor tracking or marketing IDs designed to track an individual user's activity
            across multiple websites or over time.
        </p>
        <p>
            It can include actions taken by a user during a session using a Legalitarian website, including but not
            limited to: the order and number of pages visited, buttons that were clicked, the amount of time a user
            spent taking an action, scroll position mouse cursor movement, and focus on page elements.
        </p>
        <p>
            The IP address from which requests were made may be collected in an attempt to identify misuse of
            Legalitarian websites by bots. This information may be encrypted and stored in connection with a suspected
            fraudulent form submission. If the form submission is determined to be genuine, the encrypted IP address
            will be erased. User IP addresses will never be shared with any of Legalitarian's partners.
