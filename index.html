                        <p>It's expensive to build a product instead of solving a problem because nothing is
                            one-size-fits-all when it comes to the challenges local governments face. By interviewing
                            stakeholders of a real-world problem, we identify the core goals of any project before
                            development begins.</p>
                        <p>This process is called User Discovery, and it's crucial to addressing a need at its root in
                            collaboration with people and their local governments.</p>
                        <p>Legalitarian products are available in multiple languages to meet the needs of diverse

                        <p>Hi, I'm Ryan Heisler, the Chief Advocate for People and Technology at Legalitarian.</p>
                        <p>My passion is harnessing the power of the internet to help communities tackle the diverse
                            challenges
                            they face. The most important part of building software is not writing codeâ€”it's talking to
                            people.
                            I've spent my career as a software developer and consultant building relationships with my
                            clients,
                            their stakeholders, and the end-users of their software. By building relationships with them
                            I'm
                            able to get them to open up to me about the challenges they face, and then address those
                            challenges
                            without wasting time and effort on software that won't help them.</p>
                        <p>Before my career began, I traveled the world learning new languages so I could connect with
                            people
                            and learn about their lives. I'm still looking for opportunities to do that, but now I know
                            that
                            there are worlds of people right here in Michigan. I want to get out in the community and
                            talk
                            to
                            people, and use my interpersonal and technical skills to bridge the gap between the people
                            and
                            their
                            local government and help them collaborate to address the real issues they're facing.</p>
                        <p>Southeast Michigan is my community and my home, and I'm already working to build career-long
                            partnerships that benefit the people of this region. Over 7 years, many iterations, and a
                            rotating
                            team of volunteers, I developed <a href="https://local-gov.id">a resource to help residents
                                of
                                Washtenaw County use their county ID cards.</a> It has information for them to learn
                            about
                            the
                            laws surrounding the ID, advocate for themselves, and submit complaints directly to the Ann
                            Arbor
                            Human Rights Commission when a business refuses to accept it. The ID is a critical resource
                            for
                            so
                            many people in the county, and when I'm committed to addressing a problem like that, I don't
                            quit.
