                    <p>Simple summaries of the law and links to the full text allow people to understand their rights
                        and defend themselves from being taken advantage of.</p>

                    <p>With the click of a button, residents can submit information directly to their local
                        government.</p>
                    <p>All this information is available to government staff in a centralized location - without
                        needing to answer the phone or keep track of piles of paper notes.</p>

                    <p>It's expensive to build a product instead of solving a problem because nothing is
                        one-size-fits-all when it comes to the challenges local governments face. By interviewing
                        stakeholders of a real-world problem, we identify the core goals of any project before
                        development begins.</p>
                    <p>This process is called User Discovery, and it's crucial to addressing a need at its root in
                        collaboration with people and their local governments.</p>
                    <p>Legalitarian products are available in multiple languages to meet the needs of diverse
                        populations.</p>
