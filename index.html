        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <p>Privacy is crucial to protecting the rights of the people, and to getting true and honest reports when
            someone's rights are violated. Legalitarian products will never collect information that could be used to
            identify a user, except when the user decides to submit it in a report. We will not share a user's
            indetifiable information without their consent. All information submitted by a user is encrypted in transit
            and at rest, and indentifying information like a user's name are stored separately from their reports. Users
            will never have to identify themselves or sign up for an account to access information in a Legalitarian
            product</p>
